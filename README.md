## Description
This application is a restaurant app that lets users input the name of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the application displays it on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured! Each burger in the staging area also has a Devour it button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The application stores every burger in a database, whether it is devoured or not!
